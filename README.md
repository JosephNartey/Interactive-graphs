# Real time graphs-graphs
The Interactive graphs project focuses on using an Infrared Distance sensor to determine human interaction with spaces. 
The sensor is programmed to give a counnt of interactions mades as people pass by a given space.
The count value is later graphed in real time to show how a given space is being interacted with.
The goal of this project is that, with advanced sensors, human activities can be monitored over time through graphing 
methodologies that could reveal interesting patterns on how we interact with given spaces in our community. Such information
in the long term can be used for planning and optimization purposes in when neccessary.

Project Details.
In this project, only one sensor was used. Thus, the infrared Distance sensor. A simple arduino Code is implemented to calulate the 
number of interactions made as people pass by the senor.
In addition to the arduino, a raspbery pi was used to obtain the sensor serial values from the arduino and then sent over to 
adafruit.io dashboard for real time graphing. Images of the set up are included in the folder. Screen shot of the python Nano
files that were used in implementing the above project is also share in the folder shared. 

As simple as this project might seem, it paves the way for thinking of how human interaction with space can lead interesting 
discoveries including learning about communitiy spaces and most importantly, how we interact with these spaces.
